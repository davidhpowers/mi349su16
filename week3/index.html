<h1>Affordance</h1>

<p>Affordance is the practice of styling objects to reflect on their function. The 3 line "hamburger" menu icon is a great example, because it has become the go to menu icon for many sites. Using another menu icon could possibly be confusing to the user. This site also has a search icon in the top right in the shape of a magnifying glass. That is a common approach on all websites so another icon would be confusing.</p>

<h1>Chunking</h1>

<p>Chunking divides up content so that it is easier for the user to make sense of all the information. NASA uses this method on their website as you can see in this screen shot. By splitting up relevent information in boxes, customers can quickly find what they are looking for and not be overwhelmed.</p>

<h1>Rule of Thirds</h1>

<p>Dividing a website into thirds is asthetically pleasing. The Verge uses this technique in their website to display news articles in columns. I think this site looks great and fits a lot of content on the screen without being too crowded.</p>

<h1>Modularity</h1>

<a href="http://www.starwars.com">starwars.com</a>
<p>Modularity is when a design divides a system into smaller self-contained systems. The starwars website is a great example of this because of their box like design. Each box contains all the relevent information, and could easily be moved anywhere else on the screen. This is great for mobile and responsive sites.</p>

<h1>Ockham's Razor</h1>

<a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">apple.com/mac</a>
<p>Ockham's Razor cuts away unnessary design if the simpler version can retain the same functionality. Apple's websit does an amazing job of this. Throughout the site there is minimal text, and many more pictures and descriptive icons. There is a ton of whitespace which gives a high quality feel. There is no reduction in functionality, it is just much better looking than walls of text.</p>
